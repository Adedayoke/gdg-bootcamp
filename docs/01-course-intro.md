# Course Intro

So you've decided to dive into JavaScript – one of the most powerful and widely-used programming languages on the web. I'm excited to have you on this journey! JavaScript opens the door to building dynamic websites and interactive user experiences, and with this course, you'll be using it to build your own real-world project: an **eCommerce website**!

## 📚 About This Course

This course introduces JavaScript fundamentals by building a hands-on **eCommerce web application** using real-world APIs. Whether you're new to JavaScript or brushing up your skills, this project-based approach will help you understand how to work with:

- The **DOM (Document Object Model)**
- Event handling and interactivity
- Core **ES6+ syntax and methods**
- The **Fetch API** to interact with real data
- Local storage and session management
- Timers, browser APIs, and debugging tools

We’ll use the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com) to simulate a real shopping platform and explore how modern JavaScript powers the web.

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

To follow along with this course, make sure you have:

- A modern browser (like Chrome or Firefox)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Node.js installed (recommended for live server setup)
- Internet connection (for API testing)

---

## 📐 Course Format

We’ll follow a **"learn-by-doing"** approach. Each concept you learn will be applied directly in your eCommerce project.

The app will include:

- ✅ A Login & Signup system (using `localStorage`)
- 🛒 A Home page displaying products from the FakeStore API
- 🧺 A simple cart system (optional challenge)
- 🕵️ Form validation and user feedback
- 🔄 Use of Fetch API, DOM Manipulation, and modern JavaScript

We’ll use **code blocks** for terminal commands:

```bash
npm install live-server -g

```

And collapsible sections for code changes:

<details><summary>Changes in `auth.js`</summary>// Simple login example using localStorage</details>

You’ll also see **checkpoints** to guide your progress:

:::info[Checkpoint]

LocalStorage Login System Implemented

:::tip[Tip]

Use querySelector() instead of getElementById() when you need more flexible CSS selectors.

:::

:::warning[Debug]

 If your DOM elements aren’t responding to events, double-check that your script is loaded after the DOM content in your HTML.
